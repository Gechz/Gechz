## Current endeavors
I am currently pursuing a dual degree program, combining an MBA and a Master's in Big Data at IE University. This program is a perfect blend of business strategy and data analytics, preparing me for a dynamic career in todayâ€™s data-driven world.

Iâ€™m currently learning basic SQL and Python, while prior to the program I took a separate course in R.

## Aspirations
Being in Spain is a fun experience, but I hope to go back to my home in Panama so I can bring along my experience to generate an impact in the country.
